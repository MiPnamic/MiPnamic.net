Hi, I'm the guy behind the nickname, I was born in Italy in 1983 and I grew up as a problem-solving addict, in 2004 I officially became a Developer and in 2009 I started [my own business](/company).

I love to cook and to write code;
I do not usually prepare the same dish two times in a week as well as I do not use the same technologies for two adjacent projects.

In this site you'll find an alphabetically ordered list of something that saw or sees me involved in and my opinions, even if you don't care about them.

If you want to keep in touch with me, go social and take a look right under my picture.
