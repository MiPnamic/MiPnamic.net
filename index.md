This website is about me, my company, my job, and whatever comes to my mind.

This is also an experiment, a proof of concept.

As in many other websites there is a "[Blog](/blog)" section, here on the left you can find my latest posts; there is a "[Company Profile](/company)" page strictly linked to the "[About me](/about)" page and all the links you may need to get in touch with me.

Oh yeah, before I forget, there is also a Menu in the upper left corner.

Anyway, thank you for visiting my website, whoever you are.

Please, notice: [This site doesnâ€™t use cookies](/privacy), deal with it...
