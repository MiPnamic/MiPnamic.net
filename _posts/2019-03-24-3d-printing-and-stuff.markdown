Additive Manufacturing or better, addictive.

I wish 3D printing existed while I was studying, it could have changed everything in my life.

I'm using an [Anet A8][anet-review]{:target="_blank"}, it's real cheaper [Cartesian][3dprint-explain]{:target="_blank"} one with wooden structure and parts ready to be upgraded.

<!--more-->
I found this [Ikea Lack Enclosure V2][ikea-lack-enc-v2]{:target="_blank"} and now I'm printing all the 15 pieces necessary for creating __THE BOX__, I already stacked 2 of them with anti-vibration pad in between and now I'm printing what's missing for this project.

I would like to attach a picture of it right now but the whole area is a mess... my house lack of space, then using __lack__ for creating some is almost funny... 

As my printer also lack safety features, enclosing it in a box will help in:
 - printing ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene AKA Lego pieces material)
 - monitoring the printing process (couple of remote cam maybe)
 - avoiding fire (I'll cover the whole box with fire-protection paint)

13 hours passed for the first 2 pieces, now I'll wait 20 hours for the next 2, as soon as I finish I'll calculate exactly how much time I spent on this... 3D printing is about being patient, and I am.

I would really like to print-and-build my own [Delta][3dprint-explain]{:target="_blank"} 3D printer... let's see what happen and try not to push on this.
