Speaking of the last project I wrote here on April. I messed it up.

Not the project itself but my contact. I should be ashamed of it, and I am.

I didn't kept the promise about the multitasking thing and after that personal failure I tried to rebuild my self-esteem working on another cute project.

Things are working right now, I still use multitask but I'm working it out slowly.

As far as I see, partially quoting a wonderful song: All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, undocumented feces.

New companies, new projects, new stuff, same fucking old issues.

Stay tuned.
