On December 2015 I promised to myself to not quit my next job in less than 3 years.

Guess what? It's 2 years and a half and I'm really, really close to the end.

As time goes by I realize that my worst mistake was to stop being a fulltime freelancer.

Italy is not the best place for being a freelancer at all, we have to pay too many taxes and likely the 50% of your income get burned that way.

I will go on studying for my certifications and try to apply to some DevOps job offer that I saw.
