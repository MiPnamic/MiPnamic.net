Guess what. I'm back to Jekyll.

Do you remember the guys I mentioned in my "A new era" post? I still work for them.

Finally I found a company that allow us to unleash our creativity and don't push us in using ancient technologies.

ReactJS, AngularJS, NodeJS, Redis, Cassandra, all the funniest things I studied at home instead of sleeping are now part of my daily routines.

That's why I decided to get me back on Jekyll, write my own template and have a lot of fun with Ruby.
