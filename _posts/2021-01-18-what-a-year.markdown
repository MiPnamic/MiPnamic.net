My own business? finally growing.

I'm working with a new customers that is getting bigger as we speak and it's very challenging! Finally a great playground for data-warehousing techniques to put in practice.

Upgraded Laptop, my old MacBook Pro late 2012 with no more working wi-fi card has been replaced by a MacBook Air M1.

I found my dimension in being an IT Architect, I know that I'm the CTO of the company but actually I'm more an Architect than a CTO.

No more office: we finally work remotely. (the only good things that came out of Covid-19)

As in 2018 [I was writing about quitting][here-we-go-again], well, on Feb 4th it will be 5 years in the same Company, we will see what will happen on Feb 5th.
