I moved to a new place on January 4th, a cozy place surrounded by houses not too far from Milan.

While I'm sitting here on my sofa staring at the garden, [Lady Macbeth](https://www.instagram.com/p/BQnInMdjuRc/){:target="_blank"}, my Bull Terrier, is fallen asleep and started snoring since a couple of minutes.

Lucky me.

Get back working on my personal website gave me the occasion to read again all my older posts. Since 2013 a lot of things are changed.

I planned many times to run a real blog separated from this website where I can spend some words on what I do so I started to write down a roadmap.

Organize is the first thing. It's all about Project Management, even here.
