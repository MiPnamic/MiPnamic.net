I'm addicted to Multitasking.

I really believed that I could do more than one thing at a time without losses.

The truth is that every single time that I try seriously to multitask I screw up a little bit more.

That's why I said that's enough. I'll not multitask anymore.

I'm starting a new project for a customer and I need to focus on that. I have two milestones one every 20 days.
I'm seriously thinking to complete both of them in 15 days.

I'll let you know what will happen.
