Arguing with myself on the topic: "releasing proprietary software demos".

I added to my projects some new kids but I can't actually put the link to the working website so I'm seriously thinking about rework big part of them.

I did think about putting some screenshots of them, but I believe that seeing the responsiveness with our own eyes is much better.
