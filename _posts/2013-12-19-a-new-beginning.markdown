Preparing for the new year (2014) a new location for my website:
[GitHub][github-website] pages and a new core: [Jekyll][jekyll-website].

This renewal includes [Twitter’s Bootstrap][bootstrap-website] and
[FontAwesome][fontawesome-website] as it should be. If you do not understand or
know what I’m talking about, look at their respective websites.

[jekyll-website]: http://jekyllrb.com/
[bootstrap-website]: http://
[fontawesome-website]: http://fontawesome.io/
[github-website]: https://github.com/
