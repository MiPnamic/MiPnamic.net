Another weekend is here, I do not have more spare time to spend on this website, I think this is maybe the fourth time that I change the technology behind this.

Last time it was written for Github Pages and Jekyll, this time is written in AngularJS.

Now I'm writing a simple RESTful service for managing the content, I hope to end it up soon, "too many ideas, too little time"
