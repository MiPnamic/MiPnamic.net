The first update of the year sees my projects page (reachable by my bio)
updated with just few elements inside.

I’m trying to keep this website in a single-page layout and, at the moment,
I have not intention to add more than one page per argument.
But, I know, there’s a page that probably will become unstable...
my [comments][comment-page] page...
Is not yet linked officially and probably will be not.

I love to leave some features reserved only to people who cares and read.
