The idea of being self-employed is something that never left since it came to my mind, even while I was working as an employee I never put aside my own business.

In these years I understood that opportunities hardly fall down from the sky, the real game changer is the relationship that you can build with your customer and the ability to keep it going.

Even if these sentences seem taken out from the first ten pages of a randomly chosen marketing book, being a self-employed and an employee at the same time gave me the opportunity to focus and learn that I should trust someone as soon as I started to gather new customers.

Actually I work with some professionals, with some friends worldwide and all that we do is do what we love to do.

What we do? We develop... and we drink a lot of coffee in the meanwhile. We work together for better understand our customers needs and release them what they asked for.
