In 2015 the European Parliament wrote the ridiculous "*Cookie Law*".

All of us are interested in knowing who is visiting his site and how the people have found us, well, this Law told us that we have to put an ugly note where we tell at the user that I (or someone) track down his information for statistical purposes.

Well, I quit.

This website does not use Third Party analytics or anything else.

Oh, well I put this note anyway... yeah, it sounds stupid but itâ€™s funnier this way.
